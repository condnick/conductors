		<p class="small_text"><u>Experience</u><br />
		Nicholas Logie is fascinated by the way in which conductors motivate orchestras. This fascination goes back to his early experience of playing under conductors such as Carlo Maria Giulini, Hans Swarowsky, and Gennady Rozhdestvensky in the Vienna Symphony Orchestra; and more recently, his experience of conductors such as <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/oulearn/business-and-management/podcast-2741_unlikelyleaders#!7353ae48e3" target="_blank">Simon Rattle</a>, <a href="http://www.oae.co.uk/between-playful-and-profound-%E2%80%93-new-york-with-ivan-fischer/" target="_blank">Iv√°n Fischer</a>, Mark Elder, Vladimir Jurowski, and Roger Norrington with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. In addition, Nicholas Logie has been an orchestral manager for over 20 years, working closely with conductors.</p>

		<p class="small_text"><u>Academic research</u><br />
		Nicholas Logie has recently completed a Ph.D at the Open University researching into the role of leadership in conducting orchestras. Unique amongst performing musicians, the conductor relies on others to produce sound. In addition to musicianship and technique, a conductor requires a practical and theoretical understanding of leadership in order to realise his or her potential as an inspirational musician.</p>
