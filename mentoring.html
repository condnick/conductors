		<h2>The mentoring of conductors</h2>
		
		<p>One of the key findings to arise from my research into leadership and conducting is the lack of mentoring available to aspiring conductors. By mentoring, I refer to ‘real-time’ mentoring as opposed to ‘telephone’ mentoring. The latter is usually an informal arrangement between an established conductor and protégé or the more formal provision provided by organizations such as the <a href="http://www.conductorsguild.org/resources/#tabs-resources-tab-2" target="_blank">Conductors Guild</a>. However, this form of mentoring, in which the mentor seldom witnesses the conducting of the mentee, can only be of limited use: the information received is filtered by the aspiring conductor’s own perception and does not take into account the interactive quality of the orchestra/conductor relationship.</p> 
		
		<h2>Real-time mentoring</h2>
		
		<p>Although none of the 31 respondents in the study had experienced mentoring, the research cites the experience of two established conductors who openly acknowledge the support they have received from real-time mentoring. The argument that orchestras will not respect a conductor who requires mentoring does not appear to hold water. Indeed, during my recent experience of mentoring, the orchestras appeared to be completely unaware or uninterested in my presence as observer in rehearsal.</p>  
		
		<h2>The mentoring process</h2>
		
		<p>The emphasis of the mentor/conductor consultation process is on confidentiality – the mentor’s presence remains discreet throughout. In order to maintain this confidentiality, the following three stages have been established.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Introductory meeting: the main purpose of this meeting is to clarify what the conductor plans to get out of the mentoring process. The emphasis is on supporting the individuality of the conductor. This support is non-judgemental – it is not about career prospects but about helping the conductor fulfil his or her full potential. This introductory meeting is normally provided free of charge.</li>
    	
			<li>Observation of rehearsal(s) and concert(s): the emphasis is on leadership skills. For example issues of communication, pacing of rehearsal, balance between practical and inspirational input, and understanding how the conductor can best realise his or her unique musical and technical talent. Although the presence of the mentor remains discreet, timely support and a ‘listening ear’ form part of this stage of the process.</li>
    	
			<li>Follow-up meeting: This meeting normally takes place a day or two after the project and can be face-to-face or via Skype. The issues raised at the introductory meeting are re-examined and appraised in light of observations made in rehearsal and concert. Every stage of the process is written up and this report is made available to the conductor. As with the whole mentoring process, this material remains confidential. However, if the conductor wishes to do so, he or she is free to share the experience of conductor-mentoring with others.</li>
		</ul> 
		
		<h2>Comment from a conductor during a follow-up meeting</h2>
		
		<p><i>The truth is; the mentoring process has been very revealing. All these issues that I am not so aware of and that I need to know about are important. I must say, I have been surprised by the amount of ideas you had, by the width of your views and by the amount of areas which you have covered.</i></p>
